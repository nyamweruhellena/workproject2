            <h3>Background</h3> 
             <p>Teamwork has great importance in life. It is the key to success in any field of life. It builds trust and confidence among team members and also enhances their individual capabilities. When people work together, they can achieve more than what they could have achieved working individually.There are different skills necessary for a good project or to complete a certain task. But the main thing is teamwork; if you have a great team you can execute any of your plans successfully. Whereas a group of fully skilled people without having proper bonding cannot perform teamwork well. If you are a sports lover then you can easily analyze the importance of teamwork, it is not a single good player can win the match, the entire team needs to play well and together they can do anything.</p>
